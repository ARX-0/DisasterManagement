# DisasterManagement
This device utilized LoRa communication modules to transmit essential data over 5-6 km, mush useful when cellular and internet services are provoked or stopped during disasters or natural calamities.

One real time example of this project what I faced was during December 3, 2023. Right then I was having my theory semester when heavy rain hit ChennaiðŸ’€, all our areas were flooded, power was cut, cellular services were provoked. I could'nt know about the examination until I took risk to walk through water swamps stagnated all over the road which was upto my hip.

This device could easily solve this problem, provided that someone should definitely have a receiver node.
